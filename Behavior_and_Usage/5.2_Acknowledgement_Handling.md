Although DATAGRAM frames are not retransmitted upon loss detection, they are ack-eliciting ([RFC9002]). Receivers SHOULD support delaying ACK frames (within the limits specified by max_ack_delay) in response to receiving packets that only contain DATAGRAM frames, since the sender takes no action if these packets are temporarily unacknowledged. Receivers will continue to send ACK frames when conditions indicate a packet might be lost, since the packet's payload is unknown to the receiver, and when dictated by max_ack_delay or other protocol components.

尽管**数据报帧**在遭遇丢包时不会被重传，但它们是会触发ACK的（详见《[RFC9002]()》）。接收方**应该**支持在响应接收到的仅包含**数据报帧**的数据包时推迟发送**ACK帧**（但不超过由`max_ack_delay`指定的限制），因为即便这些数据包暂时没有得到确认，发送方也不会采取任何行动。在数据包可能遭遇了丢包或时，接收方将恢复发送**ACK帧**，因为数据包的载荷对于接收方是未知的，`max_ack_delay`或其他协议组件的限制也会使得**ACK帧**恢复发送。

As with any ack-eliciting frame, when a sender suspects that a packet containing only DATAGRAM frames has been lost, it sends probe packets to elicit a faster acknowledgement as described in Section 6.2.4 of [RFC9002].

就像对待其他ACK触发帧的行为一样，当发送方怀疑仅包含**数据报帧**的数据包遭遇了丢包时，它会发送探测数据包来引发更快的确认，详见《[RFC9002]()》的[第6.2.4章]()。

If a sender detects that a packet containing a specific DATAGRAM frame might have been lost, the implementation MAY notify the application that it believes the datagram was lost.

如果发送方检测到包含着某个特定**数据报帧**的数据包可能遭遇了丢包，那么实现**可以**通知应用有关它认为该数据报遭遇了丢包的消息。

Similarly, if a packet containing a DATAGRAM frame is acknowledged, the implementation MAY notify the sender application that the datagram was successfully transmitted and received. Due to reordering, this can include a DATAGRAM frame that was thought to be lost but, at a later point, was received and acknowledged. It is important to note that acknowledgement of a DATAGRAM frame only indicates that the transport-layer handling on the receiver processed the frame and does not guarantee that the application on the receiver successfully processed the data. Thus, this signal cannot replace application-layer signals that indicate successful processing.

类似地，如果包含着**数据报帧**的数据包得到了确认，那么实现**可以**通知作为发送方的应用有关该数据报传输与接收成功的消息。由于数据包乱序的存在，可能出现**数据报帧**起初被认为遭遇丢包但是后来被接收到且得到确认的情况。必须注意，对于某**数据报帧**的确认只能表明接收方的传输层处理了这个帧，并不保证接收方的应用成功处理了数据。因此，这个信号无法代替能够表明成功处理数据的应用层信号。
